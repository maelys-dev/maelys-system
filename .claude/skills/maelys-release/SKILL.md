# Releasing a Maelys product

The product is `maelys-system`; its release mechanics come from maelys-release
at the version `.github/workflows/release.yml` pins (`docs/conventions.md`
there is normative).

## Cut a release

1. On `main`, up to date with `origin/main`: date the `CHANGELOG.md` entry
   `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` (`check` reports a `VERSION` without one),
   regenerate any generated documentation, and commit everything else.
   `VERSION` is written by `cut`, whose commit carries the bump and
   nothing else.
2. Run `bin/maelys-release cut . X.Y.Z --apply` from a maelys-release
   checkout at (any version: it runs as the pinned one). It exits 2 on
   anything the workflow would refuse (signing configuration, previous
   tag, existing `vX.Y.Z`, `release` environment not limited to tags
   `v*`) before writing anything, then commits `VERSION` signed on
   `release/vX.Y.Z`, opens the pull request and waits for the checks of
   that commit to exist and to finish. Without `--apply` it reports the
   gate and writes nothing.
3. Merge that pull request under this repository's own rules. `cut` never
   merges its own: a command that did would work only where the default
   branch is unprotected.
4. Run `bin/maelys-release cut . X.Y.Z --tag --apply`. It verifies the
   merge commit of that pull request is on `main` and carries `VERSION` =
   `X.Y.Z`, waits for every check of that exact commit, then signs
   `vX.Y.Z` on it — the merge commit, never `origin/main`, which another
   merge can move between the two — and pushes it. The tag is annotated
   and signed with a key registered on GitHub; the workflow refuses
   anything else.
5. Watch the `release` workflow; the `publish` job runs in the `release`
   environment. Verify with `gh release view vX.Y.Z` and
   `gh attestation verify <asset> --repo <owner>/<repo> --signer-repo maelys-dev/maelys-release`
   (the attestation is signed by the socle's reusable workflow, so `gh` must
   be told that signer; without it verification fails with "verifying with
   issuer sigstore.dev").

## Before the first tag, or after changing packaging

Run `bin/maelys-release rehearse . linux-arm64` (and `linux-x86_64`,
emulated) from a maelys-release checkout: it replays the Linux build job of the
release in Docker on a copy of the working tree. The release must never be
the first Linux build of the product.

## Change release or packaging files

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` and the two `scripts/checkout-dependenc*.sh`:
  never by hand. They are generated from `dependencies/*.pin`, `dependencies/packages`
  and `packaging/homebrew/*.rb.in`; change those, then run
  `bin/maelys-release adopt DIR --apply` from a maelys-release checkout at
  the target tag; check drift with `bin/maelys-release check DIR`. Every
  command answers `--format json` with an agent-cli/v2 envelope,
  `describe --format json` returns the catalog, and `--field NAME` reads one
  member of the result without a `jq` expression.
- `dependencies/<name>.pin`: nearest tag on line 1, pinned commit on line 2.
  `scripts/checkout-dependency.sh NAME` clones the dependency at that
  commit; write no other checkout script.
- `dependencies/packages`: the apt (`[linux]`) and brew (`[macos]`) packages the
  build needs, one per line. Nothing else installs packages in a release
  or in CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls the socle's
  `check-product.yml`, which reads the declarations itself; keep that job,
  add yours next to it. `adopt` updates its socle line, `check` warns when
  it is missing.
- `scripts/package-release.sh TARGET`: must leave every artifact and its
  `.sha256` in `dist/`; keep it runnable locally.
- packaging/homebrew/libmaelys-sys.rb.in: placeholders `@URL@`, `@VERSION@`,
  `@SHA256@`, plus any pin placeholder your renderer fills. Validate with
  `brew style`, `brew audit --strict` through a temporary tap, and
  `brew install --build-from-source` followed by `brew test`.
- Bottles: the tap workflow builds them on the macOS runners listed in
  `bottles`; the formula keeps its source URL so `--build-from-source`
  always works for an open product.

## Never

- push a tag whose commit did not pass `make check`;
- force-push or delete a published tag;
- edit a generated file by hand: `release.yml`, either `checkout-dependenc*.sh`,
  anything under `docs/generated/`;
- install packages from a checkout script or from `package-release.sh`;
  declare them in `dependencies/packages`;
- put credentials in the repository; the tap secrets are
  `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` and `HOMEBREW_TAP_SIGNING_KEY`;
- run release jobs on a self-hosted runner from a public repository.
